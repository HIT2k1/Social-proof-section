## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- When I use display:flex for the container, I can't set the margin-top for items as what I want. Therefore, I used transform: translateY() to solve that problem.
- To change the src attribute in HTML, I use content:url() in CSS following:
```html
<img src="./images/bg-pattern-top-desktop.svg" alt="" class="pattern-top">
```
```css
.pattern-top {
  content: url(./images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg);
}
```
